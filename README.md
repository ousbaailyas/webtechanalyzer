## Basic enveronment setup

Setting up a Go development environment on Kali Linux involves several steps. Here's an in-depth explanation of how you can do it:

### Step 1: Install Go

**Using Package List:**

```
sudo apt update; apt install golang
```

**Download Go:**
You can download the latest version of Go from the official [Go website](https://golang.org/dl/). Alternatively, you can use `wget` or `curl` to download Go directly to your Kali Linux system. For example:

```
wget https://golang.org/dl/go1.17.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

**Extract the Archive and move Go to /usr/local:**

```
tar -xvf go1.17.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz -C /usr/local/
```

**Set Go Environment Variables:**
Add the following lines to your `~/.profile` or `~/.bashrc` file to set Go environment variables.

```
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin:$GOPATH/bin
```

Then, apply the changes to your current session:

```
source ~/.profile
```

### Step 2: Verify Go Installation

**Verify Go Installation:**

```
go version
```

This should display the installed Go version, confirming that Go has been successfully installed on your system.

**Verify Environment Variables:**

```
echo $GOPATH
echo $PATH
```

Ensure that these environment variables are correctly set to the Go workspace and Go binary path, respectively.

### Step 3: Create and Run a Go Program

**Create a Go Workspace:**
Go requires a specific directory structure. Create a Go workspace folder:

```
mkdir -p ~/go/src/hello
```

**Create a Go Program:**
Create a file named `hello.go` inside the `hello` folder:

```go
package main
import (
    "fmt"
)
func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, Black Hat Gophers!")
}
```

**Run the Go Program:**
Navigate to the folder containing `hello.go` and run the program:

```
cd ~/go/src/hello
go run hello.go
```

This should output:

```
Hello, World!
```

Congratulations! You've successfully set up a Go development environment on your Kali Linux system. You can now start developing Go applications. Remember that you need to create your Go projects inside the `src` folder within your Go workspace.

## Building a Technology Lookup Tool with Go

In this guide, we will walk through the steps to create a technology lookup tool using the Go programming language. This tool will analyze websites and detect the technologies they are using. Follow these steps to build the tool:

### Step 1: Create a Project Directory

Create a directory for your project. You can choose any name for your project. For this example, let's call it "webtechalyser."

```bash
mkdir webtechalyser
cd webtechalyser
```

### Step 2: Set Up Your Go Workspace

Go follows a specific directory structure for Go code. In your project directory, create the following subdirectories:

```bash
mkdir -p src/webtechalyser
```

Your project directory structure should now look like this:

```
webtechalyser/
    src/
        webtechalyser/
```

### Step 3: Create the Code Files

Inside the `src/webtechalyser` directory, create the Go code file `main.go` and add the code for your technology lookup tool. You can use a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of your choice to create this file.

Here's a simplified example of what your `main.go` file might look like:

```go
package main

import (
    "flag"
    "fmt"
    "io/ioutil"
    "log"
    "net/http"
    "os"
    "time"
    "github.com/projectdiscovery/wappalyzergo"
)

func analyzeWebsite(url string) (map[string]struct{}, error) {
    // Create an HTTP client with a timeout
    client := &http.Client{
        Timeout: 10 * time.Second,
    }

    // Make the HTTP request
    resp, err := client.Get(url)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    defer resp.Body.Close()

    // Read the response body
    data, err := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    // Create a Wappalyzer client
    wappalyzerClient, err := wappalyzer.New()
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    // Analyze the response for web application fingerprints
    fingerprints := wappalyzerClient.Fingerprint(resp.Header, data)
    return fingerprints, nil
}

func main() {
    // Define a command-line flag for the URL
    url := flag.String("url", "", "URL of the website to analyze")
    flag.Parse()

    if *url == "" {
        fmt.Println("Please provide a URL using the -url flag.")
        os.Exit(1)
    }

    // Analyze the website and handle errors
    fingerprints, err := analyzeWebsite(*url)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    // Print the detected fingerprints
    fmt.Printf("%v\n", fingerprints)
}
```

### Step 4: Initialize Go Modules

Go Modules are a dependency management system introduced in Go 1.11. To manage dependencies for your project, initialize it as a Go Module by running the following command in your project directory (`webtechalyser`):

```bash
go mod init webtechalyser
```

This command will create a `go.mod` file in your project directory.

### Step 5: Download Dependencies

To download the required external libraries (dependencies) for your project, you can use the `go get` command. In this case, you need to download the "github.com/projectdiscovery/wappalyzergo" package, which is used for web technology analysis.

Run the following command to download the package and its dependencies:

```bash
go get github.com/projectdiscovery/wappalyzergo
```

Go will fetch the package and its dependencies and store them in the `go.mod` and `go.sum` files.

### Step 6: Build Your Tool

Now, you can build your Go tool. Navigate to the root of your project directory (`webtechalyser`) and run the following command:

```bash
go build -o webtechalyser
```

This command will create an executable binary named `webtechalyser` in the same directory.

### Step 7: Run Your Tool

You can now run your technology lookup tool from the command line by providing a URL as an argument:

```bash
./webtechalyser -url https://www.example.com
```

Replace `https://www.example.com` with the URL you want to analyze. Your tool will analyze the specified website and print the detected technologies.

### Step 8: Distribute Your Tool

If you want to distribute your tool to others, you can share the executable binary (`webtechalyser`) with them. They can run it on their systems without needing to install Go or the dependencies.

That's it! You have successfully created a standalone Go tool for web application analysis. You can further enhance your tool by adding error handling, customizing the analysis, or integrating additional features as needed. This guide provides a foundational structure for your project, and you can build upon it to create a powerful technology lookup tool.
